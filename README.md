# EatSmart
Recipe Search and Calorie Tracking App

# Description
A recipe search app that allow users to search keywords of ingredients or even specific diet. The app will generate a list of recipes according to your search. Each recipe in the search feed will display the calories per serving and the macronutrients(fat, carbs, protein) so the user can make a healthy decision. The user can signup and make a profile to start saving recipes that you've searched. In the profile, users can input their information that would be calculated to retrieve their daily calorie intake. Users can also log recipes that they've saved and the calorie calculator will deduct the calories from the logged recipe from their calorie count. This takes the guess work out of knowing how much to eat in a day.
